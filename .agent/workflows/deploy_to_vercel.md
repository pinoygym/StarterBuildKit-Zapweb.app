description: Deploy InventoryPro to Vercel

# Deployment Workflow

This workflow outlines the steps to deploy the **InventoryPro** Next.js application to Vercel.

## Prerequisites
- Install the Vercel CLI (`npm i -g vercel` or `bun i -g vercel`).
- Ensure you are logged into Vercel (`vercel login`).
- Have a Vercel account and a Vercel project created (or let the CLI create one).
- Environment variables required by the app are defined in `.env` (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).

## Steps
1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   bun i -g vercel
   ```
2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
   Follow the prompt to authenticate.
3. **Link the local repository to a Vercel project**
   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```
   - Choose the existing project or create a new one.
   - Select the appropriate framework (Next.js) when prompted.
4. **Set Environment Variables on Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
   # repeat for other vars (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL)
   ```
   You can also configure them via the Vercel dashboard.
5. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```
   This will build and deploy the app. The CLI will output the deployment URL.
6. **Verify Deployment**
   - Open the URL provided by Vercel.
   - Ensure the app loads correctly and connects to the database.

## Optional: Continuous Deployment
- Push the repository to GitHub (already set up).
- In the Vercel dashboard, enable **Git Integration** for automatic deployments on push to `main`.
