| **(Not in image?)** | **?** | **Sprinter Unico** | **34 BOX** | ❓ **EXTRA** | Found in system ADJ-01 but not in image |

## Key Findings & Recommendations

1.  **"Blend" vs "Island" Mismatch**: The most significant discrepancy is the item listed as "Blend - 27 sack" in the image being entered as "Island edited - 23 sack" in the system.
    > [!WARNING]
    > Please verify if "Blend" and "Island" are interchangeable or if this was an encoding error. The quantity is also off by 4 units.

2.  **Extra Item: Sprinter Unico**: The system adjustment includes **34 BOX** of "Sprinter Unico", which does not appear in the handwritten list provided.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Confirm if this was part of a different document or intended for this adjustment.

3.  **Naming Consistency**: Many product names in the system have an "edited" suffix (e.g., "Bakers Choice BP edited"). This might cause confusion during search and reporting.

4.  **UOM Conversions**: Items like "Quezo" (7 boxes) converted to 336 packs in inventory (48:1 ratio). This seems correct based on standard packaging.

5.  **Data Integrity**: Most other items (over 50 lines) match perfectly in quantity and unit, suggesting a high level of accuracy for the majority of the adjustment.

| Paperbag #4 | 20 rms | Paperbag #4 | 20 rem | 200 pack | ✅ Matched (1:10) |

## ADJ-02 Critical Discrepancies

1.  **Excellent 2x3 (02)**: The system records **45 pack** in inventory, while the adjustment was **45 rem**. Given that most other items follow a **1:10 ratio** (1 rem = 10 pack), the inventory should be **450 pack**. It appears to be off by a factor of 10.
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Verify the conversion factor for 2x3 Excellent plastic. If it should be 10, then 405 packs are missing.

2.  **Excellent 8x12 (02)**: Handwriting shows **20**, but the system adjustment shows **40**. Furthermore, the inventory result is **40 pack** instead of the expected **400** (if 1:10) or **200** (if 20 rms was correct).
    > [!WARNING]
    > This item likely has an encoding error (40 vs 20) AND a conversion error.

3.  **UOM Logic**: The system uses "rem" as a unit for the adjustment, but the results in inventory vary between 1:1, 1:10, and 1:48 (for Quezo).
    > [!TIP]
    > Standardize the UOM descriptors or ensure conversion factors are explicitly visible to auditors to avoid confusion.

    > [!WARNING]

- **System Adjustment**: `ADJ-20251218-0003` (Status: POSTED)

### ADJ-06 Findings: ✅ **PERFECT MATCH**
Every item (44 total lines) including cans, gallons, jars, and packs, matches the system record precisely.
- **Naming Note**: "p. cup #1" in image maps to "Cup - Baking Cup #1". Numeric values are exact.

## ADJ-07 Overview (Store)
- **Handwritten Image**: [uploaded_image_1_1766113983667.jpg](file:///C:/Users/cyber/.gemini/antigravity/brain/658c696c-3d4d-4714-9fdf-005b1a502fda/uploaded_image_1_1766113983667.jpg)
- **System Adjustment**: `ADJ-20251218-0004` (Status: POSTED)

### ADJ-07 Findings: ✅ **PERFECT MATCH**
Significant list of plastic bags (Excellent series) and shoe materials.
- All 38 entries match perfectly.
- **Naming Note**: "Water Cellophone" in image maps to "PLASTIC - Water Celophine".

## ADJ-08 Overview (Store)
- **Handwritten Image**: [uploaded_image_2_1766113983667.jpg](file:///C:/Users/cyber/.gemini/antigravity/brain/658c696c-3d4d-4714-9fdf-005b1a502fda/uploaded_image_2_1766113983667.jpg)

## ADJ-09 Overview (Store)
- **Handwritten Image**: [uploaded_image_3_1766113983667.jpg](file:///C:/Users/cyber/.gemini/antigravity/brain/658c696c-3d4d-4714-9fdf-005b1a502fda/uploaded_image_3_1766113983667.jpg)
- **System Adjustment**: `ADJ-20251218-0006` (Status: POSTED)

## ADJ-10 Overview
- **Handwritten Image**: [uploaded_image_4_1766113983667.jpg](file:///C:/Users/cyber/.gemini/antigravity/brain/658c696c-3d4d-4714-9fdf-005b1a502fda/uploaded_image_4_1766113983667.jpg)
- **System Adjustment**: `ADJ-20251218-0007` (Status: POSTED)

### ADJ-10 Findings: ✅ **PERFECT MATCH**
- **Aggregation**: Image has two entries for "Runner #5" (200 gold + 300 black). The system correctly aggregated these into a single line: **"Others - UPHOLSTERY Zipper Runner #5 - 500 pcs"**.
- All corrections on the paper (e.g., 21+1=22 for Orig #11) are accurately reflected in the system.
- All crossed-out items (Zipper #8, #3) were **included** at their noted quantities (5 roll), which aligns with the system recording them.
