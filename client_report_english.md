# Project Status Report: InventoryPro (Buenas V2)
**Date:** December 19, 2025

## Executive Summary
The system is now a fully functional, robust Inventory and Point-of-Sale solution tailored for your wholesale delivery business. It is stable, secure, and ready to handle your daily operations from purchasing to sales.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### 📦 Smart Inventory Management
*   **Complete Product Tracking:** Easily manage all your products, including their images and categories.
*   **Flexible Units:** The system understands different packaging (e.g., "Pieces" vs. "Boxes") so your stock count is always accurate.
*   **Stock Control:** Track inventory across multiple warehouses or branches. You can now easily adjust stock for large batches of items (50+) at once without errors.
*   **Audit Trails:** Every time stock is moved or adjusted, we record *who* did it and *why*, giving you accountability.

### 💰 Fast & Reliable Sales (POS)
*   **Point of Sale:** A dedicated screen for your cashiers to process sales quickly using barcodes or QR codes.
*   **Customer Profiles:** Keep track of your customers, their delivery details, and their credit limits to prevent bad debts.
*   **Sales History:** View complete logs of past transactions to analyze your performance.

### 🚛 Purchasing & Receiving
*   **Ordering System:** Create and approve Purchase Orders (POs) before sending them to suppliers.
*   **Strict Receiving:** When goods arrive, the system tracks exactly what was received versus what was ordered. It automatically calculates if there are missing items (variance), preventing losses.
*   **Supplier Management:** Keep all your vendor information in one place.

### 🏦 Financial Health
*   **Accounts Receivable:** Know exactly who owes you money and when it’s due.
*   **Accounts Payable:** Track what you owe to suppliers so you never miss a payment.
*   **Expense Tracking:** Record daily operational expenses to see your true profit.

### 🛡️ Security & Control
*   **User Verification:** *New Feature!* New employee accounts must now be approved by an Admin before they can log in. This prevents unauthorized access.
*   **Role-Based Access:** You decide who can see what. Cashiers can't see confidental admin settings.
*   **System Reliability:** We have added automated "End-to-End" tests. This acts like a robot that tests the system 24/7 to ensure no bugs sneak in when we make changes.

## Recent Improvements
*   **Better Speed:** The system now handles large data updates much faster.
*   **Duplicate Feature:** You can now copy old transaction records to save typing time.
*   **Reliability:** We performed a deep check to ensure the "Test" system works exactly like the "Live" system.
